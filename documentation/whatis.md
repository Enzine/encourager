### What is Encourager?

Encourager is a web application for excercise motivation. It helps keep track of excercises done.
A user may register and collect points from various activities. He can also add goals for others to do. Each activity has a point score and one goal can be done as many times as a user wants. When checking the goal a user can rate his performance and write down how he felt about the goal. The score brings motivation, especially when Encourager is used with friends and family. Users may see each other's profiles.
