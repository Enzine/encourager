things to do...

1. simplecov-gem and first tests.
2. Tags for searching/listing same category goals.
3. Searching by part of name as well.
5. Statistics.
6. A background picture.

(Tests, tags, background picture, prettier ui, admins can only add registrations. User can add an image. A circle around score)

- 1) For family <~> 2) for everybody?
- If 1) then every registration should be allowed by an admin
- If 2) then there must be user-based-goal-lists. Quite difficult. Maybe.
