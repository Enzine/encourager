things to do...

1. simplecov-gem and first tests.
2. Tags for searching goals.
3. A user can add how they felt about the excercise.
4. Statistics.
5. A background picture.


- 1) For family <~> 2) for everybody?
- If 1) then every registration should be allowed by an admin
- If 2) then there must be user-based-goal-lists. Quite difficult.
